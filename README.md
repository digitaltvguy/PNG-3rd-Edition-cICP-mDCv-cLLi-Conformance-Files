## PNG, TIFF, MOV, MXF with CICP, MDCV, CLLI Conformance Files<br/>
---
### GOALS - Conformance Test Files for specific Video Workflow Testing
### Determine correct detection of cICP, mDCV, cLLI in applications and operating system API's
### Verify that explicit values for color primaries and transfer functions are used
### Verify that explicit values from cICP are used for objective remapping from input to display
### and mDCV, cLLI values are used for tone mapping to final consumer display (if appplicable)
<br/>

#### Repository Folders and Files - Video Color Bars:<br/>
           1. PNG Files with cICP, mDCV, cLLI Chunks<br/>
           2. TIFF ICC Profiles with CICP Tags<br/>
           3. QuickTime MOV with NCLC(CICP) Tags, MDCV, CLLI for PQ<br/>
           4. MXF Files with Picture Essence Descriptors that mimic CICP values<br/>
